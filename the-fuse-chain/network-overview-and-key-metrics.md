# Network Overview and Key Metrics

Bankcoin is the decentralized public blockchain that powers the Bankcoin ecosystem. It is fully compatible with Ethereum meaning that any smart contract that can be deployed on the latter can also run on top of Bankcoin.

The Bankcoin blockchain uses a variant of delegated Proof of Stake \(dPoS\) for achieving consensus. The consensus is currently secured by 39 validators, only one of which is run by the Bankcoin core team.

The blockchain is designed to ensure fast block confirmation times and a low cost of transactions. The average block interval on Bankcoin is currently around 5 seconds, and it costs much less than $0.01 to get a transaction confirmed.
