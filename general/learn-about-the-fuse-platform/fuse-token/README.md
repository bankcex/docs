# BankCEX Token (BANK)

The BANK token is the native currency of the BankCEX blockchain and platform, just like ETH on Ethereum.&#x20;

## BANK utility:

* **Transaction fees** Being the native currency on the BankCEX blockchain, BANK is required to pay fees to the network in order to approve transactions.
* **Validation** Token holders can stake BankCEX to become a validator. The minimal staking requirement is 100K. The network is growing, currently there are 60 validators. ([https://status.bankcoin.io/](https://status.bankcoin.io/))
* **Voting** Validators vote on protocol changes with their staked BANK. Which means validators with higher amounts of BankCEX staked can have a bigger vote on network upgrades and governance changes (until phase 2 where delegation is activated)
* **Staking (for delegators)** Any BANK holder can choose one or more validators to delegate any amount of BANK they wish. They receive a share of the BankCEX block rewards proportionate to the share of their stake in the total stake, minus the minimum 15% fee paid to the validator(s).
* **Payments** As BANK is the native currency on BankCEX, sending it does not require interactions with smart contracts. Thus, BANK transfers are potentially faster and less costly in terms of transaction fees.

**IMPORTANT**: Merely possessing any amount of BANK tokens does not endow holders with any rights to participate in the governance of the BankCEX platform or any revenue streams related to its real-world performance.&#x20;
